    "# Computing photometry and SEDs of diffsky galaxies\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to compute photometry through arbitrary bands of galaxies in a diffsky mock, and how to compute high-res SEDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the mock data\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two cells cells show how to load the mock files that are natively produced by the diffsky source code. For purposes of this demo, we will just work with a single lightcone patch of the natively-generated hdf5 files, which will be downloaded in the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the OpenCosmo toolkit\n",
    "The hdf5 files produced by diffsky are later ingested by the [OpenCosmo](https://opencosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) toolkit, which enables efficient querying, map-making, and other features. See [Accessing and Working With Diffsky Mock Galaxy Catalogs](https://github.com/ArgonneCPAC/opencosmo-examples/blob/main/03-Diffsky/demo_diffmah_diffstar.ipynb) for a tutorial on how to load diffsky mocks with OpenCosmo."
