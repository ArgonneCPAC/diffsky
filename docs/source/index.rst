Welcome to the diffsky documentation
====================================
Diffsky is a python library providing 
`JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`__ kernels used to predict the SEDs 
of a population of galaxies 
with `diffmah <https://diffmah.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,
`diffstar <https://diffstar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, 
and `dsps <https://dsps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. 
Diffsky is open-source code that is publicly available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/ArgonneCPAC/diffsky/>`__. 
These docs show you how to use diffsky to predict the SEDs and photometry 
of a population of galaxies and their co-evolving dark matter halos.
